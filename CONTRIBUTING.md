### BUG FIXES:
---
Although extensive unit testing has been performed as _**open-ipcamera**_ has been developed, the only real validation comes when putting code out into the wild.
If you find a bug, either:
1. **REQUIRED:** Create an **ISSUE** for this project on Github, detailing:
- Version of open-ipcamera: 	/home/pi/open-ipcamera-scripts/version.txt
- Version of Raspbian:  		lsb\_release -a
- File where the offending code lives
- How it's reproducible
2. **OPTIONAL:** Create a **FIX** and send _**open-ipcamera**_ a Pull Request!

### FEATURES:
---
The organization of _**open-ipcamera**_ is *EXTREMELY* modular.  Adding features _**should be**_ reasonably straightforward.
Depending on both their merit and quality of coding, your feature may be pulled into the open-ipcamera repo.
Attribution will of course be given for your feature.


### HARDWARE DRIVERS:
---
If you have drivers you wish to be packaged with future _**open-ipcamera**_ releases, to be considered these *MUST* be:
- Opensource
- *UNCOMPILED*
- Supplied with specimen hardware with most current firmware for validation

This process is _**VALIDATION ONLY**_-NOT _**DEBUGGING**_.\
Ensure everything has been rigorously tested before seeking inclusion.\
*Policy on Failures:*  Minimum 3 months before reconsideration of your drivers.
