# MSMTP does not provide a default config file so we create one below:
cat <<EOF> /etc/msmtprc
defaults
auth           on
tls            on
tls_starttls   on
logfile        $PATHLOGSAPPS/msmtp.log

# For TLS support uncomment either tls_trustfile_file directive *OR* tls_fingerprint directive: NOT BOTH
# Note: tls_trust_file wont work with self-signed certs: use the tls_fingerprint directive in lieu

#tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
tls_fingerprint $(msmtp --host=$SMTPRELAYFQDN --serverinfo --tls --tls-certcheck=off | grep SHA256 | awk '{ print $2 }')


# Self-Hosted Mail Account
account     $SMTPRELAYFQDN
host        $SMTPRELAYFQDN
port        $SMTPRELAYPORT
from        $SMTPRELAYFROM
user        $SASLUSER
password    $SASLPASSWD
 
# Gmail
account     gmail

port        587
